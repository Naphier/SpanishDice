# SpanishDice
Simple Unity project with a pair of die that have random Spanish words on them. Made with Unity 5.3.

Provides a nice example of simple rigidbody usage, play an audio clip, list shuffling, simple data loading, and textures with normal maps. Good to use for an introduction to Unity project.
